#ARRAY LIST
Array having fixed size , so once we declare, we cant change the size.
To increase array size dynamically we have to use array list. It belongs to collection framework.
What is Framework ? - Framework is nothing but predefined methods and will guide the program.
Syntax:- List <Wraper Class> ArrayListName = new ArrayList<>():
List<Integer> leaders = new ArrayList<>();

List is an interface and interface contains incomplete methods.
Wraper class is not a primitive datatype. it's a class and in collections, we have to use wraper class only.
<> is called GENERICS.
Array list is a class and it contains complete methods.
Array List is a dynamic array. If my array size is 2 and I'm trying to add 3rd element, the size will be doubled and it will copy previous elements.
vice-versa, the array size will become half.
As ArrayList is a class, u have to import the ArrayList class. 
Now we can access all the pre-defined methods which consists in ArrayList.


# SUB ARRAYS
Arrays having consecutive elements from the Main or Original Array. 
Eg: Main: {1,2,4,5,6,7}
    Sub:- {2,4,5}

# MAXIMUM SUM OF SUB-ARRAY
IT IS A KADEN'S ALGORITHM
