In java, everything should be written in class only and main method. Whatever data given to java , it will be in the form of strings and it will store in array.

class Main{
    public static void main(String args[]{
        System.out.print("Hello");

    }
}


import java.util.Scanner;
class Person{
    void call(){
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); 
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a);
        
    }

}

class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}

in scanner class , we have multiple pre-defined methods. Thus creating an object for scanner class , u can access those pre-defined methods.

Create a class using 'class' keyword. the name of the class , starting letter of the class should be capital 
For all the methods, name of the method should be small
