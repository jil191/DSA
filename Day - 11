#STRINGS
Strings are classes and arrays are objects.The sequence of characters is called Strings.
Strings are immutable.
All the array objects will be created in int memory but strings are created inside heap memory
Once a string got created, it will be created fixed. It means we cant modify the string.

String a = "Hello";
String b = "Hello";  
System.out.print(a==b);
it will return true as it is stored in a pool 

String a = new String("Hello");
String b = new String("Hello");
System.out.print(a==b);
It will return false as the memory is stored for two different objects here. 

This == is used to compare address locations.

System.out.print(a.equals(b));
Equals is used to compare the data.
